# 2024-1 Microprocessor Applications Systems
### The team consists of @Jun-Young Oh, @Ho-Beom Han, and @Dong-Hyun Kim.

This is a project from the Microprocessor Application Systems course conducted in the first semester of 2024.

We developed a device that can levitate small-mass objects in the air through the geometric arrangement of ultrasonic transducers.

This device is capable of moving levitated objects to specific locations using a robotic arm structure.
